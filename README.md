# EAP-NOOB, Nimble out-of-band authentication for EAP 
=====================================================

About
-------- 

This repository is an implementation of new EAP method named EAP_NOOB. The new method is for secure bootstrapping of IOT appliances. The specification for EAP_NOOB can be found in [this](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-aura-eap-noob/?include_text=1) IETF draft.

The implimentation consists of three separate applications.

Hostapd : Contains EAP_NOOB server side implementation and acts as an authenticator for the requesting IOT appliances.

WPA_Supplicant:  Contains EAP_NOOB peer side implementation and contacts an EAP server through an AP to get authenticated. 

Webserver:  It Is for maintaining the account information of all the users under a realm. The out of band message is sent from or gets delivered to this web server. This server is vital for associating the  authenticating device with a user account.

	1) Access point is a wifi access point configured in WAP2-enterprise mode and OOB device is a device used by the user for delivering out of band message. An example OOB device is user's mobile phone.
	
	2) Webserver and hostapd should run on the same machine.

Dependencies
-----------------  

Following packages have to be installed before compiling any applications from  eapnoobimplimentation.

Openssl-dev (OpenSSL dev library).
libsqlite3-dev (Sqlite3 dev library).
[Jansson](http://jansson.readthedocs.io/en/2.7/index.html).
nodejs-legacy (NodeJS package).
npm (node package manager)

Compiling 
--------------
 
hostapd:

1) Move to directory  hostapd-2.5/hostapd.	
2) Open build configuration file .config and set CONFIG_DRIVER_WIRED=y and CONFIG_EAP_OOB=y.	
3) Now execute  		
  	$ make


wpa_supplicant:

1) Move to directory  wpa_supplicant-2.5/wpa_supplicant.	
2) Open build configuration file .config and set CONFIG_DRIVER_NL80211=y and CONFIG_EAP_OOB=Y. 	
3) Now execute		
	 $ make


Webserver: 

1) Move to folder nodejs	
2) execute 	
    $ npm install	
    
Configuration
---------------  

Hostapd:

At location hostapd-2.5/hostapd edit file eapoob.conf to fill in relevant data like server URL, Server name etc...

Webserver: 

At location nodejs/config edit file "database.js" to fill in the relevant data like server URL and the path to database i.e. absolutes path to database file "peer_connection_db" inside hostapd-2.5/hostapd.

WPA_Supplicant:

At location wpa_supplicant-2.5/wpa_supplicant edit file eapoob.conf to fill in relevant data like peerinfo etc...

Execution
------------  

Hostapd:

At location hostapd-2.5/hostapd  execute
$  ./hostapd  hostapd.conf	

Webserver: 

At location nodejs execute	
$ node server.js	

WPA_Supplicant:

At location wpa_supplicant-2.5/wpa_supplicant execute	
$ ./wpa_auto_run.py	

Note: 
Before executing wpa_supplicant, the network manager of the host machine must be stopped. To stop network-manger execute,
  $ sudo stop network-manger.	

Alternatively a local AAA server can also be used between the Access point and the authenticator (hostapd). The local AAA server will relay the relevant radius message to the authenticator.
